// We limit the max number of iterations because:

//    making code run faster and faster. This results in higher variance.
//    This is especially true for very fast functions.
//  - after many iterations have been run, the precision does not increase much
//    anymore. The extra `duration` should instead be spent launching more child
//    processes which are more effective at increasing precision.
//  - this avoids hitting the process maximum memory limit.
// This number if corrected by `OUTLITERS_THRESHOLD` so the final `loops` looks
// round after removing outliers.
